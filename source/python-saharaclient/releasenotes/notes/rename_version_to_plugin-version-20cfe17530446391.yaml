upgrade:
  - Option 'version' is replaced by 'plugin-version' option.
fixes:
  - Option 'version' is a global option, which is used for getting
    the client version. So there were problems with the OpenStack client,
    when we specified 'version' of the plugin, but OSC treated
    that as a request for getting the current client version. Hence, to fix
    this problem, 'version' is replaced by 'plugin-version'.
